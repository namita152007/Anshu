                <li class="question">Gravitational force acts on all objects in proportion to their<br>
                masses.Why then, a heavy object does not fall faster than a light object?</li>
                <div class="answer">It is because although Gravitational force is directly<br>
                proportional to the mass of the object but acceleration due to gravity<br>
                for any object does not depends upon mass of the object.<br>
                It can be shown below:<br>
                F=GMm
                <hr class="hr2">
                <p class="p3">R²</p>
                where F=gravitational force<br>
                G=universal Gravitational Constant<br>
                M=mass of the Earth<br>
                m=mass of the object<br>
                and R=distance of the object from centre of the Earth.
                <br><br>
                According to Newton's second law of motion,<br><br>
                a=F
                <hr class="hr3">
                <p class="p4">M</p><br>
                a=GMm
                <hr class="hr3">
                <p class="p4">R²×m</p>
                a=GM
                <hr class="hr3">
                <p class="p4">R²</p>
                Here acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass<br>
                the object.
                As the acceleration is constant for all the masses ,<br>
                hence all the object fall at a constant speed.

                <li class="question">The Earth and the Moon are attracted to each otherby<br>
                gravitational force.Does the Earth attract Moon with<br>
                a force that is graeter or smaller or same as the the force<br>
                with which the Moon attracts the Earth?Why?
            </li>
                <div class="answer">
                    The force of attraction of Earth on Moon is same as the force of attraction of Moon on Earth.<br>
                    The reason is that if we consider Earth-Moon system;then the force exerted by them on each other<br>
                    are the internal forces.According to Newton's Third law of motion,the action-raection forces have<br>
                    equal magnitude and opposite directions;so the force exerted by Earth on Moon is equal to the force<br>
                    force exerted byb Moon on Earth.

                <li class="question">If the Moon attracts the Earth , why does the earth not move<br>
                towards the Moon?</li>
                <div class="answer">
                    The Moon revolves around the earth because garvitation force of Earth on Moon provides the<br>
                    necessary centripetal force for circular montion.The Moon also attracts the Earth due to which<br>
                    Earth also revolves around the Moon in circular orbit,but due to very large mass of Eath,the<br>
                    ,the motion of Earth is not observed.It may be kept in mind that there is no linear motion of <br>
                    Earth towards Moon or Moon towards Earth.The garvitational force between them keeps on changing<br>
                    the direction of motion of Moon or Earth in circular orbit.

                    Importance of universal law of gravitation is:<br>
                    (i)It is the gravitational force that binds us to the earth.<br>
                    (ii) It is gravitational force which provides circular motion of the Moon around the Earth;<br>
                    (iii)Its the gravitational force which provides the necessary centripetal force required for<br>
                    circular motion of planets around the Sun; and<br>
                    (iv)It is the gravitational force on Earth due to Moon and Sun that provides tides.<br>
                    In general it is the gravitational force which binds up our solar system and stars of galaxies<br>
                    beyond our solar system.

                    <div class="answer"> When a body is released from a height, it begins to fall freely due to Earth's gravitational force<br>
                        acting on it. Due to this force the body experiences an acceleration towards centre of Earth.This<br>
                        acceleration is the acceleration of free fall and is called the acceleration due to gravity.
